        "content": "To view the Bluetooth devices that are currently available (i.e., discoverable) on a Windows PC, you can use the built\u2011in Settings UI, the Action Center, or a PowerShell command.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Using the Settings app (GUI)\n\n1. Press **Win\u202f+\u202fI** to open **Settings**.  \n2. Click **Devices** \u2192 **Bluetooth & other devices**.  \n3. Ensure the **Bluetooth** toggle is **On**.  \n4. Under **Add a device**, click **Add Bluetooth or other device** \u2192 **Bluetooth**.  \n5. Windows will start scanning and will list all nearby discoverable Bluetooth devices (headsets, phones, keyboards, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Using the Action Center (quick access)\n\n1. Click the **network / sound / battery** icon in the taskbar\u2019s right\u2011hand corner to open the **Action Center**.  \n2. Click the **Bluetooth** tile to turn it on (if it isn\u2019t already).  \n3. Click **Connect** \u2192 **Bluetooth** to open the same scan window as in Settings.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Using PowerShell (command\u2011line)\n\nIf you prefer a scriptable method, you can query the Bluetooth radio and list discovered devices with a short script.\u202fNote that Windows does not expose a native `Get-BluetoothDevice` cmdlet, so we rely on the `WMI` class `MSFT_NetAdapter` for the radio state and the `BluetoothLE` API via `DeviceWatcher`. The simplest approach is to use the built\u2011in `Get-PnpDevice` to list paired devices; to see *available* (unpaired) devices you need to invoke the Bluetooth APIs via a small C# snippet, but a quick way to list **paired** devices is:\n\n```powershell\n# List currently paired Bluetooth devices\nGet-PnpDevice -Class Bluetooth | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'OK' } |\n    Select-Object -Property FriendlyName, InstanceId\n```\n\nFor a live scan of nearby (unpaired) devices, run this PowerShell script (requires Windows 10\u202f1809+ and PowerShell\u202f5.1+):\n\n```powershell\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime\n$watcher = [Windows.Devices.Enumeration.DeviceInformation]::CreateWatcher(\n    [Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.BluetoothDevice]::GetDeviceSelector()\n)\n\n$watcher.add_Added({\n    param($sender,$args)\n    $device = $args.DeviceInformation\n    Write-Host \"Found: $($device.Name)  (Id: $($device.Id))\"\n})\n\n$watcher.Start()\nWrite-Host \"Scanning for Bluetooth devices... Press any key to stop.\"\n[Console]::ReadKey($true) | Out-Null\n$watcher.Stop()\n```\n\n- Open **PowerShell** as your user (`saza`).  \n- Paste the script above and press **Enter**.  \n- The script will print the name of each device it discovers until you press a key.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Using Command Prompt (limited)\n\nThe classic `netsh` command can show the Bluetooth radio status but not a list of nearby devices:\n\n```cmd\nnetsh wlan show interfaces   # shows Wi\u2011Fi; Bluetooth not listed here\n```\n\nTherefore, for device discovery, the GUI or PowerShell methods are preferred.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist\n\n- **Bluetooth enabled?** Settings \u2192 Bluetooth toggle **On**.  \n- **Airplane mode off?** Ensure it isn\u2019t disabling radios.  \n- **Device discoverable?** The device you\u2019re looking for must be in pairing/visible mode.  \n- **Drivers up\u2011to\u2011date?** Run **Device Manager \u2192 Bluetooth** \u2192 right\u2011click your adapter \u2192 **Update driver** if you see issues.\n\nFollowing any of the methods above will show you the Bluetooth devices currently available for pairing on your Windows system."
