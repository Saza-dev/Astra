# Kylie
Kylie is a minimal taskbar voice assistant powered by CrewAI agents. It stays in your system tray. Built in Python, it handles everyday OS tasks (via os) and web actions (via Selenium) locally fast, private, and distraction-free. Your invisible co-pilot for files, apps, and the web.

Note: Under Development
