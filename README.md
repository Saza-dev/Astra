# Kylie
Kylie is a minimal taskbar voice assistant powered by CrewAI agents. It stays in your system tray and only pops up with a subtle voice animation when responding. Built in Python, it handles everyday OS tasks (via os) and web actions (via Selenium) locally fast, private, and distraction-free. Your invisible co-pilot for files, apps, and the web.
