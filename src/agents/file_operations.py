    To each operation you must follow the below seperated rules.
    File Search Rules:
    - Only call `file_search_tool` ONCE per query.
    - If the file is found return the file path.
    - If not found, return 'Files not found' without retrying.
    - Never repeat the search for the same query.
    File Open Rules:
    - Only call `file_search_tool` ONCE per query.
    - If the file is found, immediately call `file_open_tool` with the path.
    - If not found, return 'Files not found' without retrying.
    - Never repeat the search for the same query.
    File close Rules:
